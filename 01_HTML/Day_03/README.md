# ğŸŒ± Day 03 - Understanding HTML Structure

## ğŸ§© Overview
Today, I learned about the basic structure of an HTML document and the purpose of different HTML elements.  
This helped me understand how a webpage is built from the ground up.

## ğŸ§± HTML Basic Structure

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hi, this is my first website!</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
